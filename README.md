# Andromeda Trader
Andromeda Trader is a C#-based programming competition game. Its universe was inspired by the computer game Elite. The players write AIs in C# which guide spaceships, trade in various commodities, raid other players, purchase better ships and equipment, and so on. The goal is simple - get as rich as you can. 

The codebase is mature and can be deployed in a few minutes. See [the Deployment Guide](/deploy/Andromeda_Trader_Deployment_Guide.pdf).

Let the race begin!

Note that the code was originally written in 2012 using technologies (ASP.NET 4, .NET Framework 4, Azure Cloud Services) which were current at the time but are somewhat outdated now. It still runs well anyway.
