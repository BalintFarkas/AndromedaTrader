# AndromedaTrader
Andromeda Trader is a C#-based programming competition game. Its universe was inspired by the computer game Elite. The players write AIs in C# which guide spaceships, trade in various commodities, raid other players, purchase better ships and equipment, and so on. The goal is simple - get as rich as you can. 

The codebase is mature and can be deployed in a few minutes. See Andromeda Trader Deployment Guide.pdf for instructions.

Let the race begin!
